All of our cats see a veterinarian shortly after their arrival and are examined along with being vaccinated and spayed or neutered before going to their new homes. Because ours is a small shelter we are at present only able to take cats deemed as \"adoptable\" into our program. Therefore, we are currently a \"limited-access\" shelter, which means we do not euthanize to make room for incoming animals. We may have a waiting list. We can be a resource to help you locate an animal shelter, humane society or rescue in the state that may be able to assist you. We can provide general information on animal care, solving behavior issues and direct you to local resources. We believe the best way to reduce the issue of overpopulation and thus reduce the number of homeless cats and dogs, is to spay and neuter. We hold reduced cost spay and neuter clinics several times a year."

msgid "Our volunteer base grew quickly over the past few months. Several months ago, we didn't have enough volunteers to provide the level of care that Kingdom Animal Shelter had dedicated itself to. There was talk of closing the shelter if we couldn't find a way to improve upon what we were doing and to have a volunteer base that would allow us to provide the community the services we have been."

msgid "Thankfully, we were able to get the word out and our community came out to support the shelter. Our volunteer base more than doubled. This provided us with quite a challenge. Organizing and tracking volunteers became very difficult with our old system. Communication was difficult for us among so many people. Now have enough volunteers to do so, we have adoption hours 7 days a week but before we were not prepared to handle so many volunteers and to have the additional scheduling needs related to set up a work schedule. That is why we went in search of a better way to handle our scheduling."
msgstr "值得庆幸的是，我们能够得到了这个词，我们的社会走出来支持住房。我们的志愿者基地一倍以上。这提供了我们相当大的挑战。志愿者组织和跟踪变得非常困难，我们的旧系统。沟通是我们很难在这么多人。现在有足够的志愿者这样做，我们必须通过小时，每周7天，但在此之前我们并没有准备好要处理这么多的志愿者，并有额外的调度需要有关成立一个工作日程。这就是为什么我们在寻找一种更好的方式来处理我们的调度。"

msgid "Previous Scheduling Method"
msgstr "以前的调度方法"

msgid "Previously because we had fewer volunteers, most with a set schedule, it wasn't really \"tracked\" as much as it was just \"known\". If someone was unable to cover a shift, or would be away, they'd send an email to our \"Go To\" person and she'd scramble to cover it often going in herself."
msgstr "此前，因为我们有更少的志愿者，大部分一套日程，这是不是真的“跟踪”一样，因为它只是“已知”。如果有人无法覆盖转变，或将要离开，他们会发送一封电子邮件到“走出去”的人，和她争相在自己经常去掩盖它。"

msgid "Our weekend adoption schedule changes from month to month. The person who was handling that sent out a poll via email for people to sign up for whichever Saturday or Sunday they wanted to cover for the month and it was left at that."

msgid "Since ShiftPlanning"
msgstr "由于ShiftPlanning"

msgid "We looked at several options and the work scheduler ShiftPlanning had everything we needed and we think it will work for us as we need it to. It admittedly took us quite some time to filter through everything and get things changed over to ShiftPlanning. We only started to actively use the work scheduler at the start of this year. So our experience with it is a bit limited but I can say that it has made things much easier and I can see where it will be very useful."
msgstr "我们看了几个选项和工作的调度ShiftPlanning了我们所需要的一切，我们认为，因为我们需要它，它会为我们工作。它承认我们花了很长一段时间过滤通过的一切，得到的事情发生了变化，以ShiftPlanning。我们才开始积极利用在今年年初的工作调度。所以，我们与它的经验是有限的一点，但我可以说，它已使事情变得更加简单，我可以看到这将是非常有用的。"

msgid "ShiftPlanning has helped manage our schedule in a more organized way. When we doubled our volunteer base, our Volunteer Coordinator started delegating scheduling duties for our various shifts. We had someone scheduling our morning cleaning volunteers. Another person was scheduling our Tuck In volunteers and yet another was scheduling our Adoption Counselors. Some of our volunteers fill multiple roles and with three different people doing the scheduling in three different ways, on paper, things were either being over looked or unnecessarily complicated."
msgstr "ShiftPlanning帮助更加有组织的方式管理我们的时间表。当我们加倍我们的志愿者基地，我们的义工协调员开始委托调度的职责，为我们的各种变化。我们已经有人安排我们早上清洁志愿者。另一人被安排在志愿者的塔克和另一个被安排我们通过辅导员。我们的一些志愿者填写多个角色，并与三个不同的人做的调度，在三种不同的方式，在纸上，事情被过分看着或不必要的复杂。"

The Studio moved from a highly informal to a more formal structure over the years, starting with Mr. Berghof himself simply accepting payments directly from students when they arrived for class with him (if he actually made them pay in the first place). Eventually an assistant would handle accepting payments and as the operation grew, a full-time registrar was hired, then a business manager, then more registration staff, maintenance staff and so on."

msgid "Many of the office functions were handled early on by teachers or students on a voluntary basis, sometimes in exchange for class time, and sometimes as short-lived part-time gigs to pay the bills. As the organization was originally a sole ownership, the rules were fast and loose at the time and a lot of people got jobs working for the organization simply as a way of Mr. Berghof helping them out during a rough time."

msgid "After Mr. Berghof's death, his widow, the renowned stage actress and one of the Studio's teachers, Uta Hagen, arranged to have the organization moved from a sole ownership to a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The staffing continued to become more structured and formalized. After Ms. Hagen's passing, the organization eventually settled on being headed by an Executive Director, who is currently supported by an Operations Manager, Finance Coordinator, and Director of Development at the top end, along with a number of registration staff, janitorial and maintenance, and some supporting administrative staff."

msgid "Our current scheduling challenges start with the fact that our full-time registration staff are paid hourly and have flexible schedules.  Given the patchwork of staff availability and our obligation to provide a minimum number of hours to staff designated full-time means that shifts are never a fixed length from one day to the next. That overlaps with the difficulty of tracking vacation time accruals, and also vacation time usage. For the part-time hourly staff, we do our best to award work hours in reasonable proportion to stated availability."

msgid "Our previous work scheduler system was simply for one of our managers to take staff availability by e-mail, then calculate availability by hand, then assign shifts by hand, and issue the schedule to staff in a pre-formatted Word document. Time sheet tracking was accomplished by an custom-made Excel spreadsheet on a server accessible to staff from any work station in the office."

msgid "We stuck with the old work scheduler system as long as we did mostly because of inertia. When we were ready to make a move, we looked at several offerings, but we found ShiftPlanning to be the best solution because so many other systems didn't actually provide BOTH scheduling AND time sheet tracking.

If no members select a shift, manual assignment is made from the list of available members with that skill set. For example, only some of our members are tow plane qualified and can be scheduled on that shift. Since we fill out our schedule for the month, sometimes people are on vacation and we must schedule a double shift.

The notifications have been particularly helpful, we tell workers that if they don't want to receive notifications, that's their own decision, but they have no excuse to forget when their shifts are.

Scheduling is a challenge trying to schedule mainly new employees around their varied other commitments.  We have a very young staff so we are scheduling around University and College schedules.  We have had employees calling in to see when they work.  We have employees who miss shifts and claim they didn’t know they were scheduled.  Managers find little pieces of paper on their desk saying that an employee can’t work their shift the next day.  These are likely common issues with anyone who hires young workers but our staff is almost entirely this demographic."
